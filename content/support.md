### Don\'t worry - we\'re here to help

Make the most of your Virtualmin and Cloudmin deployments, find quick solutions to common problems, and get direct assistance from the developers of Webmin, Virtualmin, Cloudmin, and Usermin. Usually, the quickest way to get answers is as follows:

### Step 1: Search for similar questions

If your question has been asked before, you might be able to find an answer in minutes and get your problem knocked out before we even know it exists. If a search does not provide good answers, proceed to step 2.

### Step 2a: Open a ticket in our support tracker (Pro customers)

If you need fast and reliable support, open a premium ticket by sending us a [private message](https://forum.virtualmin.com/new-message?groupname=staff&amp;body=|++SYSTEM+INFORMATION||%0A|------------------------------|-------------------------------|%0A|++OS+type+and+version++|+++++REQUIRED+++++|%0A|++Webmin+version+++++++++|+++++REQUIRED+++++|%0A|++Virtualmin+version+++++|+++++REQUIRED+++++|%0A|++Related+packages++++++|+++SUGGESTED+++|%0A%0A%0A%0A) on the forums. If you have any active Professional product, your tickets are always free.

### Step 2b: Ask the community (GPL users)

If you can wait for answers from our community and don\'t want to spend any money, ask your question in the forums. Every member of the Virtualmin staff also monitors the forums, and tries to help out whenever we can. We generally prioritize paid support queries (we\'ve got bills to pay, after all), but our forums are very active and our community is knowledgeable.

[Go to the Forums](https://forum.virtualmin.com/)

### Step 3: Found a bug?

If you\'ve found a bug in Virtualmin or Cloudmin, GPL or Professional, please file a bug in the relevant [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/virtualmin/) for the project you\'re reporting on, or [post to the forum](https://forum.virtualmin.com), or report to the appropriate `security@` email address if reporting security issues. It benefits everyone when you let us know about bugs you find in our software.
