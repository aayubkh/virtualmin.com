Virtualmin can be installed in a number of ways, including an automated install script, which uses the standard package management features of your OS, and software repositories containing our software in native package formats. We strongly recommend that you use the automated install script to install Virtualmin, if at all possible.

Most people can just follow the simple instructions on the [Download](/download/) page. Return here if that proves insufficient.

#### [Automated Installation](/docs/installation/automated/)

Installation of the full Virtualmin stack using our automated install script. This is the recommended way to install Virtualmin.

#### [Manual Installation](/docs/installation/manual/)

Installation of Virtualmin and related packages manually. This method is time-consuming, and requires a high level of technical experience. This is _not recommended_, except in cases where the automated installation is inappropriate or impossible.

#### [Installation Troubleshooting](/docs/installation/troubleshooting/)

Troubleshooting common problems encountered during installation. 

#### [Uninstalling Virtualmin](/docs/installation/uninstalling/)

Uninstallation, downgrading from Virtualmin Professional to Virtualmin GPL, and selective removal of packages.
