### Origin

**Virtualmin** was founded by **Jamie Cameron** and **Joe Cooper** in 2005. We provide virtual host administration products based on [**Webmin**](https://webmin.com/about) - the world\'s most popular web-based UNIX and Linux system administration tool, with over *3 million* downloads every year.

### History
As open source developers, we\'ve been working on solving real systems management problems for two decades and written over a half million lines of code in the process. Jamie created **Virtualmin**, **Webmin** and **Usermin**, as well as authored the *Bruce Perens\' Open Source Series* book titled *Managing Linux Systems with Webmin: System Administration and Module Development* (Prentice Hall PTR, 2003). Joe wrote *The Book of Webmin: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love UNIX* (No Starch Press, 2003) and founded *Swell Technology LLC*, an open source-based web-caching appliance vendor in operation from 1999 to 2005. It is merely an eerie coincidence that both of our initials are JC.

### Facts
**Virtualmin** is in use by more than a thousand hosting providers worldwide. **Webmin** is the world\'s most popular web-based system administration tool, and is used by *RackSpace.com*, *Hosting.com*, *Lycos Europe*, *University of Texas*, and thousands of other companies and individuals world-wide. In 2007, **Virtualmin** accepted funding from *Y Combinator* and became a *Delaware Corporation*. In 2009, we announced **Cloudmin**, a cloud computing management UI and platform for development of cloud computing services.

### Us

In short, **Virtualmin** is four guys (**Eric Andreychek** joined us in 2008 and **Ilia Rostovtsev (a.k.a Ilia Ross)** joined us in 2014) trying to tackle really big problems in hosting and cloud computing management.
